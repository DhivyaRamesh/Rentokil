To avoid any possibility of your child/children not having anything to eat on a day where you have not placed your School Meal order in time, you may wish to arrange for your child/children to take a packed-lunch into school.  If your School does allow your child/children to have a School Meal where you had not ordered one, your School will determine how this School Meal will be paid for by you.

If your child/children’s Dietary Requirements cannot be met, you will be entitled to receive a refund.  You will not be entitled to receive a refund of your School Meal where an alternative and suitable meal has been provided.

                                                <ol><li>Unless the provisions of paragraph 7.2 below apply, you may only cancel a School Meal that you have ordered where you have amended the information in your Account no later than the deadline defined by the School.
                                                    </li><li>We recognise that there may be instances where your child/children do not attend or are taken out of school, for example, because they are ill, and they are then not able to have their School Meal.  In such cases, please update your Account with notification of such absence by the deadline defined by the School, in which case we will be able to carry over the payment for the School Meal to the next School Meal your child/children takes.  We are not able to carry over such payment if notification is not received by the deadline defined by the School.  We will not be able to refund your Account in either circumstance.  
                                                    </li><li>If you do not cancel any School Meal within the time period set out in paragraph 7.1 above, then you will not be entitled to a refund for that School Meal and you will lose that money.

                                                    </li><li>Where you have paid the School in cash, and where the School was responsible for crediting an Account on your behalf, you will need to liaise with the School to obtain your refund.  For the avoidance of doubt, in cases where you have paid cash to your school, whether any refund will be payable to you shall be at the discretion of the School, and it is not our responsibility to manage this for you. 
                                                    </li><li>We cannot offer refunds for amounts below the cost of a full meal left on the Account at the end of a School term/year so please make sure that the amount on your Account is used up by that time.   If your child remains at the School in the following term, the account balance will roll over.  See clause 9.1 for details of refunds.

                                            </li><li>As there is no maximum amount that you can top-up your Account, we would recommend that you monitor the balance of your Account regularly, and that you do not top-up your Account so that the balance exceeds the number of school meals available to your child/children in any given school year.  This will avoid you having an excess balance in your Account at the end of each year.
                                            </li><li>You will not accrue any interest on the balance of your Account.
